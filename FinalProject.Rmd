## Data Description and Cleaning Steps

For our analysis, we will use a dataset obtained from **https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data/resource/9851a37f-4f32-464e-8ba6-c23023653a7f, or https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot, or 
https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/CISS/**, which contains detailed information on road crashes, including vehicle types involved, speed at the time of the crash, crash severity, weather conditions, and other related features.
